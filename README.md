# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe MCTS

This program uses Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Upper Confidence Trees to play a user in the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was solely intended as a tool for better understanding how to implement MCTS and therefore is very inefficient. Hopefully this code will serve as a launching point for more complex future projects...

There are still some bugs with move generation but as this project was only meant to teach me more about MCTS, I am going to leave it for now
