# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe MCTS

This program uses Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Upper Confidence Trees to play a user in the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. This project was solely intended as a tool for better understanding how to implement MCTS and therefore is somewhat inefficient, espically the python implementation. The Java implementation runs very quickly and is a very strong opponent. Hopefully this code will serve as a launching point for more complex future projects...
